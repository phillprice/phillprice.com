Taken at half 8 on a September night. This is the new glowing sign, as opposed to the lit from the front on a white square one that's attached to Stamford Brook - North side.

Ridiculously short (for the point and shoot Pentax I used back then) exposure with a saturation boost (only just - I've just checked the original) in Lightroom<a href="/photos/2008/03/01/the-roundel"></a>
