Believe it or not, the only adjustments made to this photo is the angle (I was on a boat - try keeping steady!). The gorgeous sunset captured while we went fishing on our honeymoon, off the West coast of Meeru island in the Maldives. The specular rays are simply astounding. - <a href="/photos/2008/06/19/maldivan-sunset"></a>
