This reminds me of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1407103156?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=maxxed-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1407103156" rel="nofollow">a book I read as a child</a> where the lighthouse keepers lunch is passed down on wires like these - and is taken daily by seagulls until the sandwhiches are made hot - <a href="/photos/2009/06/30/the-lighthouse-keeps-lunch" rel="nofollow"></a>
