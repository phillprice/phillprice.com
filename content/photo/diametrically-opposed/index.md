I love the diversity of the London skyline; even though many say oh look another tall box they are all different. On the right is the Aviva building looking like it's a fortress. On the left the Swiss Re Gherkin. They both look like theyve falln from another planet - but I guess one's from Venus and another Mars. - <a href="/photos/2009/05/14/diametrically-opposed"></a>
