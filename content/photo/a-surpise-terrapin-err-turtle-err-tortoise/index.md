Today I decided to cover the route that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrmeetups/discuss/72157623872676175">LondonFlickrMeetups</a> made a few weeks ago to which I couldn't attend. 

I was expecting a fairly vague affair walking along the Thames. The usual herons, geese, gulls, ducks, cyclists, runners etc. 

Just as I was getting to Richmond (by the floodgates) I spotted this chap basking in the sun. 

By the time I left he had quite a crowd. All wondering what kind turtle, tortoise or terrapin it is? Any ideas?<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2010/07/17/a-surpise-terrapin-err-turtle-err-tortoise" rel="nofollow"></a>
