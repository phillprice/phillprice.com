Not only is this a bright red car (its a Diplomatic Protection Group car, and the dots at the top of the windscreen signify that they're armed!) it's also not brilliant at hiding behind the fence is it with it's lights on... On the plus side they didn't arrest me for taking a photograph of them. You can see this car in action <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUmY0YRAFQE">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2QLAFqgNcE">here</a>

Can you tell a theme at the moment? Yep I'm trying to debunk the myth of the UK war on photography that frankly doesn't exist. 

I'm also back on one post a day after the chunk of London PhotoWalk shots from the weekend. - <a href="/photos/2008/08/26/failing-to-hide"></a>
