This is a sculpture by <a href="http://charleshadcock.co.uk/works.asp?gotoid=6&amp;fmyear=2002">Charles Hadcock</a> which I found at the rear of <a href="www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-2776.php">The Last pub on Shoe Lane</a>.

Gorgeous curves huh? in case your wondering the main star is a taxi driving around a corner. - <a href="/photos/2008/02/10/cantus"></a>
