When I posted the processed photo <a href="/photos/2009/02/07/pinnacle">Pinnacle</a> I said I'd release the original for others to play with. So if you go over to here and <a href="/photos/2009/02/21/edit-my-photo-project">fill in the form</a> I'll send you the RAW / JPG to play with - post your results and share how you did it. Good luck! - <a href="/photos/2009/02/21/edit-my-photo-project"></a>
