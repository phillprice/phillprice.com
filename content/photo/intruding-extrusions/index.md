I love how its extrusions intrude on a gorgeous sky (or is it the other way round?) 

The brand new Towner building. Thanks to <a href="http://www.rickmather.com/practice#/project/towner">Rick Mather Architects</a> and my favourite <a href="http://www.blueprintmagazine.co.uk/index.php/architecture/new-seaside-architecture">Blueprint Magazine</a> for bringing it to my attention. Fittingly it's the new home of an art gallery. - <a href="/photos/2009/05/11/intruding-extrusions"></a>
