I was lucky enough to climb the bell tower of St Peter and St Paul Church* in Ringwood, where I grew up and got married. I managed to get a giant hdr panorama (which may or may not work) and also a few details, such as this lovely stonework. *Those of you who drive down the A31 should recognise the church as you drive through Ringwood. - <a href="/photos/2008/10/12/an-ancient-flourish"></a>
