This line running through the middle lines up the louvre, the Arc de Triomphe and Le Grande Arche. Taken from the top of the steps of the Arch (itself turned to make another line with La Tour Eiffel and La Tour Montparnasse) you can see (when viewed large) people enjoying the arch, with photos looking at it, photos looking the other way, lunch, afternoon chats, a very personal moment in the life of a city, and one of my favourites from the day.<a href="/photos/2008/09/15/axe-historique"></a>
