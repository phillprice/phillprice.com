This shot is one of the few I'm posting from my 20 minute boat trip along the Thames from Canary Wharf to Embankment where I fired off 650 shots! In this shot you can just see the star of the sun glimmering through the Tower Bridge support - with MoreLondon and it's building work on the left.<a href="/photos/2008/07/01/sunset-at-tower-bridge"></a>
