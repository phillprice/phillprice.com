This chap is one of only 130,000 in the world, in the UK he's one of 52 breeding pairs. He's on the <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/commonscoter">UK RSPB Red list</a> as his numbers have halved in my lifetime. Of the wild ones, <a href="http://www.nixonbyname.com">Chris Nixon</a> is the likeliest to see them as he's resident up in the Scotland. This chap lives in Arundel in Sussex. I call him Daffy due to his distinctive beak :)<a href="/photos/2008/08/06/daffy-the-common-scoter"></a>
