This shot (about 7 months old) is from a cold day with the wind flowing through this horse's hair. He came over to say hello while Dad and I walked through the forest. I think he trusts me, and I trust him. Interestingly I'm watching Walk the Line in the background, and the colour treatment appears to have worn off unexpectedly!<a href="/photos/2008/08/29/mutual-trust"></a>
