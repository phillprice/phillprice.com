This is a new angle on the bridge I've got a few shots of, and a particularly nice one. behind it you can see the building work at Arrowhead, and my office to the bottom right. it's rare that I'm up this early, but the light is worth it. I may do it more often!<a href="/photos/2008/05/06/gorgeous-city-morning"></a>
