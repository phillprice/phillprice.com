Well at least i think it's a fur coat (hopefully fake) but he could equally be a bit hairy. I went out with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-portrait-photography">LPPMG</a> today, and the weather twisted between this bright sun, and hail storms complete with lightning! Great bunch mind you!<a href="/photos/2009/03/29/not-your-typical-cycling-gear"></a>
