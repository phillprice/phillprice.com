Many people say the golden hour is the best time for shooting; for me its twilight; and by twilight I mean any of the three twilghts; but preferably Nautical Twilight while there's more colour in the sky. 

You can read about the three on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight#Definitions" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a><a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/11/08/into-the-night" rel="nofollow"></a>
