A pair of coworkers(?) enjoy a quick if frosty pint in the Cat and Canary pub in Canary Wharf. Across the dockReminders of the dock's past in front of the Marriott Curve hotel; and a bright DLR station in the far background.<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/11/24/a-quiet-pint" rel="nofollow"></a>
