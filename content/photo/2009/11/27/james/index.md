PhotoLegal's resident lawyer James Barisic - complete with comedy hat and his new camera. 

Today was the first time I met James; we had a live show to put on for the <a href="http://web.incisive-events.com/ptg/2009/11/vision/index.html" rel="nofollow">BJP vision09</a> conference; and he's a thoroughly wonderful chap in the flesh! If you listen to <a rel="nofollow">PhotoLegal</a> you'll know by now that you can find him on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jamesmb" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.socialholic.co.uk" rel="nofollow">his blog</a>.

Big thanks to Olivier and the troops at Incisive Media's BJP for letting us have a spot to record in my extended lunch break.<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/11/28/james" rel="nofollow"></a>
