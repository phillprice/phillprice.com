Commisioned in 1630 this statue was the first of its kind. It now sits in the middle of a traffic island which is the point at which all signs leading to london end. All London Mile Markers are mapped from this spot. In the background is St Martin in the Fields and further behind the spinning globe a-top the London Coliseum<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/11/27/charles-i" rel="nofollow"></a>
