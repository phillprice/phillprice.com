<a href="http://www.timeslicefilms.com" rel="nofollow">Time Slice Films</a>. You've probably seen their work (<a href="http://www.thebill.com/videos/videodetail/item_2000053.htm" rel="nofollow">The Bill</a> comes to mind); but not known the people behind it. 

Similar to the bullet time of the Matrix the cameras here have all been manually focused; tethered to fire and store images to be fed in to a video clip. In this rig there are 66 cameras; feeding into 8 machines which number and feed images into another machine which makes a clip all within a few seconds making it broadcast ready. <a href="http://www.timeslicefilms.com/canon.html" rel="nofollow">See work captured while we were there</a>!

And yes for some reason I managed to accidentally focus on Camera #42 :)  taken in <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/ProPhotoSolutions" rel="nofollow">Canon Pro Photo Solutions in Angel</a>.<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/10/30/automatica-paparazzi" rel="nofollow"></a>
