A commuter heads for the Thames Clipper ferry at Westferry, in Docklands. Thames Clipper are a fleet of boats that ferry people up and down the Thames as an alternative to the tube. They get very busy if the tube isn't working!<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/10/20/starting-a-long-dark-journey-home" rel="nofollow"></a>
