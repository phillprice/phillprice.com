This bridge in Budapest - the 'Széchenyi Chain Bridge' was made by an Englishman named William Tierney Clark. Although it looks a little like Tower Bridge, he built the original Hammersmith Bridge (which is now replaced by one made by Joseph Bazelgette  - who also created London's sewer network.) So although it looks familiar it's not exactly as you'd think.<a href="/photos/2009/09/06/a-familiar-bridge-budapest" rel="nofollow"></a>
