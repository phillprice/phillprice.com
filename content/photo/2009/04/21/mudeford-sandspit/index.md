These are some gorgeous beach huts - the kind you can only use for 6 months of a year. They are at the base of Hengistbury Head - a regular haunt of ours when I'm back in Dorset. I've always wanted a shot of this hut (which I believe is a lifeguard hut in the summer?)<a href="/photos/2009/04/21/mudeford-sandspit"></a>
