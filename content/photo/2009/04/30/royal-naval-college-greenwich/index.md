I decided to process this to make it look like a painting of the glorious structure. The sky is really that gorgeous (albeit not that colour... ) and its one of 6 versions that my wife and I chose to look the best in this split tone. I'm stood on the home of time to take this photo; The Greenwich Meridian (even if the GPS puts me a whopping 20 seconds West).

&quot;The Old Royal Naval College is the architectural centrepiece of Maritime Greenwich a World Heritage Site in Greenwich London, described by UNESCO as being of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot; and reckoned to be the &quot;finest and most dramatically sited architectural and landscape ensemble in the British Isles&quot; . The buildings were originally constructed to serve as the Greenwich Hospital, designed by Christopher Wren, and built between 1696 and 1712. The hospital closed in 1869. Between 1873 and 1998 it was the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Naval_College,_Greenwich" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a><a href="/photos/2009/04/30/royal-naval-college-greenwich" rel="nofollow"></a>

Do you prefer <a href="/photos/2009/04/30/royal-naval-college-greenwich" rel="nofollow">warm or cool processing</a> for this photo?

If you're interested I talked about the photo on <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/13069-royal-naval-college-greenwich" rel="nofollow">my daily AudioBoo feed</a>
