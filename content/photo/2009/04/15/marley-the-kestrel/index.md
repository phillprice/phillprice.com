One of the birds you're most likely to see along side a road in Britain is a Kestrel like this (he's a male - the females are all brown). 

Amazingly they see UV light and track rodents' urine trail along verges before hovering above them. 

Sadly the toxic nature of roadsides are affecting the food chain; so they may not be around for long.<a href="/photos/2009/04/15/marley-the-kestrel"></a>
