On the way back from photowalklondon I stopped back on Oxford Street at a place I had on my list of shots-I-must-take from a visit earlier in the week with no camera but with a wet reflective floor. This is  in a tiny allley leading into <a href="http://www.stchristophersplace.com" rel="nofollow">St Christopher's Place</a> a square just behind Oxford Street which is a not so well kept secret these days!<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/12/07/christmas-lights-with-a-difference" rel="nofollow"></a>
