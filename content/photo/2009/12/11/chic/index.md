Sometimes the best shots aren't the ones you'd expect.I chose this one from the pile today as its so vibrant and fresh. 

A quick heads up - I'm away up until Christmas but I have a chuck from the archives that are ready and will pop up while I'm away so no fear! The first part of my break is in New York so I expect them to show up after Christmas if I don't get time to sneak them in here or there!<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2009/12/12/chic" rel="nofollow"></a>
