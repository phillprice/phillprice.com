This bridge carries cars over the 'middle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chines" rel="nofollow">chine</a>' leading down to Bornemouth beach. It's a panorama but sadly I blew the highlighs on it; and on the journey back the light had completely changed :( . Still I like it.<a href="/photos/2009/07/07/under-the-bridge" rel="nofollow"></a>
