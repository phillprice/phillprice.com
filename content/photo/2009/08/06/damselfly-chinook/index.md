I almost binnned this photo as it took a while to spot that I caught this pair just after take off. They are flying in a pair for mating. I'm not sure if this is before or after as the male doesn't want the female to mate with anyone else!<a href="/photos/2009/08/06/damselfly-chinook" rel="nofollow"></a>
