Another shot from the tower of St Peter and St Paul's Church in ringwood; this time looking South West along the A31. 

Interestingly I think the lights are bouncing; rather than the camera as the road is sharp. It's a shame the gantry to the right blocks the light but I love the movement of indicator lghts to the bottom left and the green cats-eyes in the slip road (along with the cones sat by the service station - and the one all by itself at the bottom!)<a href="/photos/2009/06/03/changing-lanes" rel="nofollow"></a>
