Tomorrow morning we leave for a wedding in the country. So I'll be out of internet access (unless there's 3G access there) but have no fear! I've set photos to go up over the weekend and into next week!

By the way - did you know I've been talking about each photo as <a href="http://audioboo.fm/profile/phillprice">AudioBoos</a>? What do you think?<a href="/photos/2009/05/01/goodbye-london"></a>
