Back on the same evening I took <a href="/photos/2009/03/17/three-angels">Three angels</a> I took this shot looking South towards the Morgan Stanley Cube. The sky is really that colour (mainly due to the orange citi lights reacting with the deep blue sky).<a href="/photos/2009/05/15/stars-everywhere-but-the-sky"></a>
