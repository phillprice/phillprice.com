A reshoot of a <a href="/photos/2008/01/09/a-starry-night">shot I took</a> (<a href="/photos/2008/03/17/im-in-print-well-canvas">and have hanging on my wall</a>) that I wanted to improve on. In fact I come through here often enough to see that today's evening sky and lowering cloud were going to make this a scorcher. With any luck it'll be hanging on another wall soon! If you're interested <a href="http://twitter.com/phillprice/status/1343921196">I tweeted &quot;the equipment&quot; used</a> for this shot. - <a href="/photos/2009/03/17/three-angels"></a>
