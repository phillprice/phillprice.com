Whilst up on top of the Church tower in Ringwood showing dad how to make light trails - I shot this river or two; you can see the main A31 going across the picture; and the Salisbury road going to the top left. White balancing this is a nightmare! - <a href="/photos/2009/05/06/rivers-of-light"></a>
