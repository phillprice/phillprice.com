In the mid nineties I came with a school trip to Canary Wharf. When I got home I told my parents that one day I would work there.

For the past five years I have been, you can see both offices in this photo, and I've enjoyed 99% of the minutes I've been here. 

I started work 3 days after 7/7 and during the failed second attempt at 'Silver Control' (just under the sunburst highlight) and when I left two years later I worked at the building at the bottom right. 

One of my favourite photos was taken on the Thames Clipper on the way into the City, and I recreated it on my last journey home on Tuesday. The icing on the cake was the moon shining between the buildings, emphasising the end of an era.

On Monday I start a job in the suburbs, for a while I'll miss this centre of the Earth, when will it pass?<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2010/09/24/goodbye-canary-wharf" rel="nofollow"></a>
