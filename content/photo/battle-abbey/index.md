&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Abbey">Battle Abbey</a> was founded to commemorate the battle [of hastings in 1066], and dedicated in 1095. The high altar of the Abbey church was reputedly on the spot where Harold died. The Abbey gateway is still the dominant feature of the south end of the main street, although little remains of the rest of the Abbey buildings.&quot; - wikipedia - <a href="/photos/2009/05/12/battle-abbey"></a>
