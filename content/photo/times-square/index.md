At the turn of the year a giant ball drops over Times Square; but do you know why?

It leads back to (you guessed it!) London - and in particular the observatory looking over the docklands. Captains used to set their time from a ball dropping on top. It dropped at 1pm - 60 minutes after they observed high noon  when the Sun is at it's highest.<a href="http://www.phillprice.com/2010/01/25/times-square" rel="nofollow"></a>
