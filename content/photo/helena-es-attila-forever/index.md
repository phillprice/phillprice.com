I've seen this in London on very few occasions - I had no idea when visiting Pécs that it would be the heart of the movement. 
&quot;Beginning in the 1980s, in the centre of the southern Hungarian city of Pécs, lovers began to clamp padlocks to a wrought-iron fence in a narrow street linking the mosque in the city's main square and the magnificent medieval cathedral, as a symbol of their commitment to one another.&quot; - Wikipedia - <a href="/photos/2009/07/31/helena-es-attila-forever" rel="nofollow"></a>
