This is the first of a bunch of shots I'm uploading straight from the 5D MkII camera I was lucky enough to play with yesterday (Thanks to Canon and 1000heads!) The only thing I've done in lightroom is add metadata. This shot is at 6400, ad it could easily pass for 400 from my 400d. The 5 of us believe this must somehow create light!
