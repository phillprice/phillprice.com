I went to Paris to get this one shot! Yes it was worth it and you can see from other shots that day I got a lot of shot's I didn't expect! This is my final shot this year (unless I get anything new and spectacular) - but don't panic! I've queued up a week of posts on how a photo gets from the camera to the web (well how I do it) Mainly not to show off but to ask if you've got any tips. So head over to <a href="http://www.phillprice.com">www.phillprice.com</a> tomorrow at 12pm UK time for the first article!<a href="/photos/2008/12/24/le-grande-arche-de-la-fraternite"></a>
