      recommendation: "I worked with Phill for 4 years whilst at CSL Web, collaborating on many projects together. <br> <br>As technical lead for CSL Web his experience, knowledge and dedication was second to none. This was a great example to the junior developers who strived under his management. <br> <br>Phill was a great character within the office and one of the smartest developers I have had the privilege to work alongside."

Mentored and managed a team of apprentice and junior developers who now lead projects, deliver work to clients and have customer facing skills to effectively communicate with them.

Proactively implemented a process of containerised infrastructure, continuous integration and deployment along with dependency package management. Achieved quicker, more resilient deployment through having a single source of truth.

Implemented Test Driven Development through Behat, Cucumber and Selenium testing. Generated more robust regression testing, reducing the incident count by 65%.
