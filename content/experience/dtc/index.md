      date: "May 12, 2007, Matt was senior to Phill but didn't manage Phill directly "
      recommendation: "I worked with Phillip for approximately a year and I can say that it was a pleasure to work with someone with a 'can do' attitude to their work. I'm sure Phillip's knowledge/experience has grown since he left the DTC, which combined with his work ethic should make him a valuable addition to any team. "
