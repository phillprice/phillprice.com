Boston Ivy is a company dedicated to making the web a simpler and safer place. We do this through our six generic top level domains (gTLDs). They are .forex, .spreadbetting, .markets, .trading, .cfd and .broker.

As a Senior Developer at Boston Ivy I've been responsible for recruiting a 'pod' of developers in our sister office in Krakow replacing a team of contractors in London.

Aside from the personnel changes I successfully implemented a set of processes that take a simple ad-hoc code operation to a single server to a cloud architecture with immutable containers hosting fully tested code with stops in place to halt any faults before they reach live service.

I've played an active part of developing features for the flagship sites for Boston Ivy: news.markets, reviews.spreadbetting get.trading and trade.forex. Whilst intimately code reviewing and mentoring the team of developers to get better code out of everyone (and learning a lot on the way!)
