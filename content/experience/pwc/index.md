      title: "Head of Growth and Digital, PwC UK"
      date: "September 23, 2010, Nick was senior to Phill but didn't manage Phill directly "
      recommendation: "As the lead Documentum developer for web publishing at PwC Phill has become an invaluable resource to the firm. Having joined early in the product's lifecycle, he has shaped much of the environment in which we now work, and helped define the client experience. He has helped us create a fairly complex environment publishing mutliple web properties for different audiences. It has always been a pleasure working with Phill on any of these projects as he understands much more than the technicalities of web publishing. This has helped us resolve difficult issues easily, quickly and successfully on a number of occassions. Phill is extremely personable and easy to deal and clearly will be a great asset to any organisation looking to develop its online publishing presence. "

A keen and passionate team player, he has proved himself to be trustworthy and reliable.  Phillip has a personable manner and continually shows fast and accurate responses to incidents/outages and problems.  Phillip's excellent and detailed industry and account knowledge give credence to his choices, which significantly improves the end user experience.  He is known to keep an open mind when considering options which has been beneficial during long ongoing issues/incidents.  He is well respected within his team and UK IT as a whole. I whole heartedly recommend Phillip and have faith that he will be a significant asset to any company. "

His ability to resolve issues quickly, providing clearly thought out solutions accounting for future implications is facilitated by his extensive knowledge of the Documentum Web Publisher application and supporting products.
